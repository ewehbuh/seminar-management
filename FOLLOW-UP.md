## Implementation:

**Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?**  
(Explain any additional libraries or tools you included and their purpose.)
No extra libraries were used
 
**Q) What libraries did you add to the backend? What are they used for?**  
(Explain any additional libraries or tools for backend functionality and what they are for.)
Dependencies and Their Functions

bcryptjs (^2.4.3)Used for hashing and comparing passwords to securely store sensitive data like user credentials.

cors (^2.8.5)Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the server to accept requests from different origins.

dotenv (^16.4.7)Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env, helping manage sensitive configuration data.

express (^4.21.2)A fast, unopinionated web framework for building RESTful APIs and web applications.

jsonwebtoken (^9.0.2)Implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and secure data exchange between client and server.

mongodb (^6.12.0)Provides tools and utilities to interact with a MongoDB database at a low level.

mongoose (^8.9.5)An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, offering schema-based solutions for database interactions.

nodemailer (^6.10.0)A library for sending emails from Node.js applications. Useful for notifications, user verification, and password recovery.

swagger-jsdoc (^6.2.8)Generates Swagger documentation from JSDoc comments in your code, creating API documentation automatically.(was still to use)

swagger-ui-express (^5.0.1)Serves a user-friendly web interface for viewing and testing your API using Swagger documentation.(was still to use)

**Q) How does the application handle the assignment of trainers and the email notification feature?**  
(Describe the implementation of the email functionality and how Mailhog was used for testing.)
from the courses page, the user routes to the trainers assignment page. 
this page  contains the selected course and the best availble teachers for that course.
All competent teachers whose schedule fall within  the same course schedule date are hidden
the display of trainers are displaayed from the most competent(trainer with most subjects) to the least
when the assign button it clicked the courseid and trainerid are sent along side a token to the backend where checks are made and an email is sent to the trainer containing  the course name and course id. mailbog was used to locally test email notifications.
**Q) What command do you use to start the application locally?**  
`(Provide the command, e.g., docker-compose up, npm start)`
 
 `npm start`

## General:

**Q) If you had more time, what improvements or new features would you add?**  
(Discuss any potential enhancements, such as improved UI, new functionalities, etc.)the
I left out the display of  trainers assinged to a specific course. thats a key feature that can provide a clue to already assigned  trainers before any addition assignment action can be performed

The addition of forgotten password and the modification of the home page to display left out meta data

**Q) Which parts of the project are you most proud of? Why?**  
(Highlight the parts of the code that you think are most well-written or efficient.)
-the code is well structured making it easier to idenfier files and isolate bugs 
-Most features implemented in the backend are outstanding including getting the best trainers for a subjetc, preventing the display of an already assigned user for a particular day,  and others
`const Course = require('../models/Course');
const Trainer = require('../models/Trainer');

const getBestAvailableTrainers = async (courseId) => {
  // Fetch the course details for the given courseId
  const course = await Course.findById(courseId);
  if (!course) throw new Error('Course not found');

  const courseDate = new Date(course.date).toISOString().split('T')[0]; // Get the date (YYYY-MM-DD)

  // Fetch all trainers
  const trainers = await Trainer.find();

  // Filter trainers who are not assigned to any course on the same date
  const availableTrainers = await Promise.all(
    trainers.map(async (trainer) => {
      // Find courses assigned to the trainer
      const assignedCourses = await Course.find({ _id: { $in: trainer.assignedCourses } });

      // Check if any assigned course has the same date
      const hasDateConflict = assignedCourses.some((assignedCourse) => {
        const assignedCourseDate = new Date(assignedCourse.date).toISOString().split('T')[0];
        return assignedCourseDate === courseDate;
      });

      return hasDateConflict ? null : trainer; // Exclude trainers with conflicting dates
    })
  );

  // Remove null values from the filtered trainers
  const filteredTrainers = availableTrainers.filter(Boolean);

  // Further filter for trainers with at least one matching subject
  const matchingTrainers = filteredTrainers.filter((trainer) =>
    trainer.trainerSubjects.includes(course.subject)
  );

  // Return matching trainers or all available trainers if no match
  return matchingTrainers.length > 0 ? matchingTrainers : filteredTrainers;
};

module.exports = { getBestAvailableTrainers };

**Q) Which parts did you spend the most time on? What did you find most challenging?**  
(Describe any difficulties or complexities you encountered during development.)

The mailbog email provider that was used was new to me and i had to do reasearch in other overcome the challenge.
Assigning the best available trainer to a course and sending emails to the trainer after a course has been assigned. it was quite complicated to come up with the best logic 
 
**Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you encounter any issues or difficulties completing it?**  
(Provide feedback on the testâ€™s difficulty and any areas that could be clarified or improved.)
The test was cool. i learnt a lot in the process 
most of the challenges faced were some minor mistakes that were made on both the  frontend and the backend . 

**Q) Do you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test?**  
(We welcome suggestions to improve the interview process or the structure of the test.)
the test is good as it CUTS across most domains of full stack development. 
i have no major suggestion for now
